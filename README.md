# SoPC
I created a system on a programable chip using Altera's DE2 FPGA board and Quartus II. Made this project for McMaster's 3TB4 Lab 4. I created an SRAM interface using Verilog HDL and used Qsys to generate a softcore processor, on chip memory and JTAG UART. These are connected with the SRAM interface using avalon switch fabric. Signaltap II is used for debugging the signals being sent across the SRAM interface. This was compiled and loaded onto the DE2 board. Using NIOS, I created code to send data to the SoPC. The C code tests the circuit by writing of characters, shorts and integers.
